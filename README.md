# Visual Regex Builder

A lightweight, static Visual Regex Builder prototype implemented as plain HTML files (multiple iterations/versions) that can be opened directly in a browser.  

## What’s in this repo
This repository contains multiple versioned HTML files (for example: `visual regex builder 0.html`, `visual regex builder 1.html`, …) representing different iterations of the project.  
There is also an MIT license included.

## Quick start
### Option A — Open locally (fastest)
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open any of the HTML versions in your browser (for example, `visual regex builder 11.html`).
3. Use that file as the “current” version, or compare versions to track changes.

### Option B — Serve locally (recommended)
Some browsers restrict certain features when opening files directly from disk. Serving locally avoids those issues.
